## UBC CPSC 210 Project

Android app that lets you find the fastest public transit route to get to the location of another user in Metro Vancouver 


## How it works

The app queries an API to retrieve the location of other users of the app and report the location of the current user. To find a route to another user, the app queries [TransLink's Open API](https://developer.translink.ca/) to determine the fastest SkyTrain/bus route.

## TODO
This project is not completely finished, here's a list of todos:

- the API for user locations was used for the duration CPSC 210 and then it was taken down. So make a new API
- Allow users to create accounts and add their friends.
- The current app uses its own custom map; switch to Google Maps 
- maybe Facebook integration?
